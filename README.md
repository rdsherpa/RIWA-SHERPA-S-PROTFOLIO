# <Riwa-Dorjee-Sherpa's-Protfolio>

## Description: 
- I wanted to make protfolio of mine where it look more professional, where people can see my work and easily reach me.

- I build this project because I wanted to build a website of my own where people can easily reach me through my work. I wanted to apply all the knowledge that I have learned and apply them at the same time.


- The problem that this website solves it that I don't have to show case my work and protfolio to my clients juggling through social media. People and clients can easily reach me through this. 

- What I learned from this challenge project was that apply what you have learned, research more, ask for help if you get stucked, and give your best to make this website look appealing. I also learned new thigs like media queires, hover over and different CSS styles.
